I implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch using only Python and plain Numpy.

The goal is to understand the rationale behind algorithms that you can run in a single line using one of the various packages for ML that Python provides (scikit-learn) by breaking them down into elementary blocks and assembling them from scratch.
